OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT
Project: EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS (EDA) on TITANIC DATASET
Objective:
The objective of this project is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to gain insights into the factors that influenced passenger survival rates during the Titanic disaster. By analyzing the data's characteristics, distributions, correlations, and outliers, we aim to identify key features that significantly impact survival and visualize these findings to support further predictive modeling.

Key Insights to Look For:
-Survival rates across different classes, genders, and age groups.
-Impact of fare and socio-economic status on survival.
-Influence of family connections (siblings/spouses and parents/children) on survival rates.
-Correlations between features and their collective impact on the likelihood of survival.
